  "Tests for the oracle itself.

  `readback` exists so the export tests can decode instead of pattern-matching.
  That only helps if the decoder is right, and a decoder written by the same
  hand as the encoder is the classic way to be wrong in both places at once.
  So every expectation below is the answer an outside implementation gives for
  the same bytes -- Python 3's `csv` module (`strict=True`, `newline=''`) and
  its `json` module -- recorded on 2026-08-31.

  The refusal cases matter as much as the accepting ones. An oracle that reads
  a corrupt document as a plausible one reports a green round trip for an
  exporter that has stopped working."
