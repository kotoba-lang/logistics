;;
;; ## Why a second runner exists
;;
;; `kotoba.logistics` says of itself that it is "portable (.cljc) across JVM /
;; ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM", and until now nothing had ever run it
;; anywhere but the JVM. A portability claim that no runtime checks is a
;; docstring, not a property -- and the failure mode is specific: a host
;; interop call that a JVM run cannot see is wrong. `kotoba.logistics.export`
;; already carries a comment saying `json-hex4` avoids `Long`/`Integer` interop
;; "that would only work on :clj". Nothing tested that. `clojure -M:test`
;; structurally cannot: it is the runtime the interop would work on.
;;
;; The same trap is written down in `scripts/maturity-loop/run.cljs` in the
;; superproject: a `#?(:clj int :cljs identity)` mutation scored 0 failures
;; under `clojure -M:test` and 11 under nbb.
;;
;; `kotoba.logistics.ui` is deliberately not here. It requires `html.core` and
;; `css.core`, which arrive as git deps the JVM toolchain resolves; putting it
;; on this classpath would make the run depend on a checkout that the mutation
;; sandbox does not have, and a runner that cannot start reports the same thing
;; as a runner that found nothing wrong.
;;
;; ## Three exit codes
;;
;; 0  every test ran and passed, and enough ran to mean something
;; 1  something failed
;; 2  REFUSED -- too little ran to report a pass at all
;;
;; Without the floor, a require that silently resolves to nothing, or a
;; namespace dropped from the list below, prints the same "0 failures" as a
;; full green run (CLAUDE.md, ADR-2608136000, question 2). The marker on stdout
;; is printed only on a real pass.

  These are the counts of THIS run, which is the JVM suite minus
  `kotoba.logistics.ui-test`. The first version of this file carried the JVM
  totals by mistake and the floor refused its own green run -- which is the
  floor doing its job, and worth leaving on the record: a number copied from a
  different run is exactly the kind of thing that otherwise sits here unnoticed
  until it is too low to catch anything."
