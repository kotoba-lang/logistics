  "Shipments, tracking numbers, routes and freight — pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the cloud-itonami-4920 (community
  freight transport) open business. No network, no I/O. Models the records a
  logistics operator keeps: shipment records, tracking-number normalization
  and structural validation, route legs, and freight/consignment records.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."
